            2.1.1) Describing the content and layout for each page 
        </h4>
    </div>
    <p class="central container">
        The content of each page is fairly straight forward. Each page is a different outcome from either unit 1 or 2 and answers the questions posed in each outcome. Each question is in bold as it is a “heading” and the question follows as a paragraph. There is a simple background (a picture taken in Lake Como – which doesn’t do the scenery any justice!)  and tabs at the top of each page to help you navigate from one page to another with ease.

    <p class="central container">
        Copyright law was formed in the UK in 1709. With time this developed into the Copyright Act. The current act is known as the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. To avoid copyright, it’s imperative to reference your sources and to ask your sources for permission to use their content on your website. If not, this could result in legal issues such as lawsuits later on, should the source take issue to you using their content without permission or reference.

            2.1.6) Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them 
        </h4>
    </div>
    <p class="central container">
        All disabilities must be accounted for when creating a website. The main ones that affect those when visiting a website are visually impairing disabilities such as short or long sightedness and those who are colour blind as well as the possibility of flashing lights affecting those with epilepsy. With a picturesque background it was important to maintain a box style around the writing with a more consistent and neutral background for the text so that it was easier to read. I also used a large enough font size so that the text wasn’t a chore to read. In addition, I also ensured there were no flashing lights on my website. Had I included any animations, I would have also made sure these weren’t flashing too.

            2.1.7) Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites 
        </h4>
    </div>
    <p class="central container">
        The filetypes I used were HTML, CSS and JPEG. This does not mean that the website is limited to these three filetypes however. Instead of JPEG, I could have also used JPG or PNG filetypes. If I had wanted to add audio to my website, I could have used an MP3 filetype or WAV, FLAC, or M4A. Further to this, if I had wanted to throw in an audio-video filetype, I would have used an MP4 filetype or alternatively I could have used MOV or WMV.
