        Hi, I’m Sai. I recently graduated with a BSc (Hons) Mathematics degree from the University of Warwick and am currently looking for a job as a Technical Consultant. Since technical/digital/technological consultants are required to have some knowledge in software development, I decided to join Code Nation and learn some coding languages. Prior to attending the course, I had minimal coding experience and had no idea how far I would come within such a short space of time. To have been able to work with such a fun and supportive group of people has been a pleasure, and I’m thankful to each and every one of them for inspiring me along my journey with Code Nation.
