            1.2.1) Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello 
        </h4>
    </div>
    <p class="central container">
        Personally, I was content with the tools used; in particular, I found Visual Studio Code straight forward to use. The colours that appear when coding make it easier to spot errors. In addition, the fact that one programme can be used to code for Python, HTML, CSS and more makes coding a breeze once you get your head round it. I was less content using Trello as I didn’t feel the Kanban technique was as useful on an individual project. It took time to maintain an adequate Trello board, which I thought could have been better used working on the website itself.

            1.2.2) Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello 
        </h4>
    </div>
    <p class="central container">
        Visual Studio code was extremely appropriate and useful for the reasons mentioned in the previous question. I don’t think it could have been much more efficient and no ideas spring to mind on what kind of software would be more appropriate to use. As for Trello, it was useful to help plan ideas, however as an individual carrying out tasks by myself I didn’t feel that Trello held an equal importance as it did when carrying out tasks as a group. Simply writing a ‘To Do’ list would have been as efficient without the need to detail each individual task as required on Trello.

            1.2.3) Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?

    <p class="central container">
        My website is simple to understand and easy to navigate. This allows a user-friendly interface which is important across all age groups – a key target of mine. However, I would have liked to include more to help the website appear advanced and as modern as possible whilst maintaining the user-friendly experience. For example, I would have tried to incorporate a dark mode feature using a moon icon (and to switch back to light mode, a sun icon). In addition, I realised that changing the size of the browser window affected how the content was viewed. It meant that the designed tab bar became distorted, and the text boxes below stayed as they were (i.e. shortening the width of the window meant you couldn’t read the entire text box). I would have liked to centralise the tab bar and textboxes. Ideally this would mean that by shortening/extending the browser window one could still easily read the content without having to zoom out of the page. I would have liked to also add features such as animations – having the textboxes fade in would have looked cool, and perhaps more professional.

            1.2.4) Describe further improvements you can make to your project 
        </h4>
    </div>
    <p class="central container">
        I feel the website is adequate however not to the standards I believe I could achieve. I underestimated the time required to build an efficient and aesthetically pleasing website to focus on the written content for the site. I would have liked to include more (such as more social media icons and a tab bar across the top). I know that after this course, I will look forward to developing my website to incorporate such things and improve my ability as a web developer.

            1.2.5) Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose 
        </h4>
    </div>
    <p class="central container">
        I regularly reviewed each outcome and adjusted them accordingly to improve them until I was content with how the website looked. For example, I would change the transparency of the text box and the colours and fonts used throughout the duration of the project. Generally, I’m happy with how the website looks and it serves its purpose of introducing who I am, as well as presents the written work in a presentable manner. With more time and experience, I look forward to improving this website or potentially creating a new website which goes above and beyond the current Code Nation curriculum.
