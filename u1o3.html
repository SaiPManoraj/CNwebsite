            1.3.1) Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?

        Increasing productivity by working in teams would have worked. By allocating different tasks to each individual, we could have gotten to our outcome quicker. Not only this, but we could have harnessed our individual strengths to produce a higher quality piece of work. Having said this, there are also drawbacks of teamwork. In particular when working on creative projects. The main one being creative differences. For example one person may desperately want the tab bar to be across the top of the webpage whereas another may want it down the left hand side. Similarly, one may want a dark themed website whereas one may want a light themed website. Although one would hope that those with creative differences can reach a compromise, there is no guarantee that this will happen – a risk that could potentially elongate this project and make it more inefficient.

            1.3.2) Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
        </h4>
    </div>
    <p class="central container">
        The main way to improve productivity and efficiency would have been to undertake the project of building a website in a group and dividing up tasks between us equally and in favour of each of our strengths. Teamwork aside, I could have increased productivity by asking for help earlier on rather than trying to tackle the problem myself for so long and spending too much time trying to fix simple issues. Had I asked Jay sooner for help, I would have been able to finish off that part of the project much quicker, enabling me to move on to adding social media icons and animations such as fading from one page to another. I must be wary of when to hold my hands up and ask for help.

            1.3.3) Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? 
        </h4>
    </div>
    <p class="central container">
        I would certainly use a team to carry out tasks. Creating a channel on Slack to share coding content would certainly help. Furthermore, carrying out tasks over zoom calls and screen sharing so that everyone can input ideas to the IT project whilst one person inputs them has worked for me in the past. However, the team should take it in turns to be the person screen sharing and inputting code, as this tends to be the person bearing the weight of the project. As long as the whole team take it in turns and offer to do this regularly, this can prove to be more efficient. Aside from this, as mentioned before when working as a team, we could divide the tasks equally and allocate them according to each individual’s strengths.

            1.3.4) Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions 
        </h4>
    </div>
    <p class="central container">
        The easiest way of going about testing digital solutions would be to get family and friends to test the user interface of the website. I got my sister to have a look at the website and asked her to attempt to navigate from one page to another on the website without any help from myself. She managed to do this successfully. Furthermore she gave individual feedback to help me improve my website. Using a larger sample test group with a wide range of ages, ethnicities and a fair mix of genders will help to give feedback which is likely to appeal to a wider scope of clients/customers.
