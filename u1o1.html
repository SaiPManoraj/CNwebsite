            1.1.1) Describe the purpose of IT in modern business
        </h4>
    </div>
    <p class="central container">
        Modern businesses are relying on IT more and more. Whether it’s an individual advertising and selling homemade cakes via Instagram or large multinational corporations using machine learning and analysing big data to increase efficiency within the company, its uses are limitless. The increase in IT in modern business is largely down to its unparalleled accessibility. Everyone in the UK nowadays has a smartphone and/or access to a computer, which makes browsing the internet.

            1.1.2) Describe methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? 
        </h4>
    </div>
    <p class="central container">
        Nowadays, most digital projects rely heavily on the researching and analysing of data before using that data effectively. As information has become more digitally accessible, we practice researching via the internet rather than finding books in the library. Aside from researching and analysing skills, you may need software to help you analyse data. This varies from the basics of excel towards more technical software such as Tableau and Power BI, and then of course coding software such as Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Aside from these tools, having a team of experienced individuals to help each other is more valuable, as not only do you get validation of your work, but having people to help through your weaknesses enable you to complete these projects quicker to a greater quality.

            1.1.3) Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board. 
        </h4>
    </div>
    <p class="central container">
        I used a Trello board to plan out the tasks I had, in order to help me prioritise them and carry them out efficiently and without forgetting any small details. The Kanban method has helped maintain efficiency throughout both projects (making the text game on Python as well as making this website). There are negatives to this as it requires constant updating online which can take up precious minutes. Despite this, Trello helps to rule out the error of forgetting to carry out certain tasks, which overall takes precedence.

            1.1.4) Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? 
        </h4>
    </div>
    <p class="central container">
        There are many risks that may impact digital projects. This could be as basic as your computer or digital device shutting down whilst you’re working. This may only cost you a minute or so whilst it reboots however, should you fail to save your work as you progress it could result in the loss of your work – something I’m sure we have all experienced at some point! Aside from this trivial example there are many others that can heavily impact digital projects. Whilst creating something digitally, we are forming certain assumptions. For example, we assume that the software will need a certain operating system. What happens when half way through the project, the operating system is updated and the current project won’t work on this updated software? It sets you back and could mean a delay in the project which could have costly implications. What happens when the company who produced the software you’re currently using releases an End of Life statement for the software stating that it will be discontinued. Even if you complete your project before this, will the digital project be useful still be useful a year after? If not, you may wish to reconsider the software being used. To mitigate these issues, it may be wise to plan ahead and to have backups for each potential risk from the start of the project to prevent time lost and panic midway through the project.

            1.1.5) Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? 
        </h4>
    </div>
    <p class="central container">
        It is important to find the right systems and software for your target market. This could be designing a very basic app which sets alarms for OAPs to take their medication, or it could be a project to encrypt data to keep private files secure. Each of these two examples require very different software. Once you have narrowed down the potential software, then you can look at which one is less costly, more efficient, or is just preferred by the people in your team (since they have previous experience using it).

            1.1.6) Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control 
        </h4>
    </div>
    <p class="central container">
        Trello has helped me to plan more efficiently and remember each component of the entire project. GitHub has allowed me to share my website with others online amongst a community of web developers. By sharing my website I hope to gain exposure to the web development world. In addition to this, by viewing and analysing other web developers’ websites, I’m sure I can further my knowledge and pick up little things to make my website better. GitHub also ensures my webpage can be viewed using different web browsers.

            1.1.7) Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? 
        </h4>
    </div>
    <p class="central container">
        New GDPR legislation (as of May 2018) has allowed a greater deal of transparency between people using websites and those collecting, storing and using the data of such people(i.e. data controllers and data processors). For those developing websites, it is important to bear in mind the impact of GDPR. This accounts for IP addresses, fingerprints, cookies, and any other system-generated data that identifies an individual.
